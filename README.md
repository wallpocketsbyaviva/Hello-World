# Hello-World
This is my GitHub test project. I am doing this project to familiarize myself with Github so I can make edits to my Wall Pockets website. 

I'm Excited!

P.S. This is my editted branch. I'm hoping to use this info to really launch my site. I'm wondering if I should just focus on Instagram for sales and use the site as a gallery. Or just no site at all, maybe just a personal website...?

This is a file edit.
